	<p>I am currently a Moore/Sloan Data Science and WRF Innovation in Data Science Postdoctoral Fellow at the <a href="http://escience.washington.edu/" >eScience Institute</a> at the University of Washington.  Most recently, I have been working with <a href="https://pdhoff.github.io/">Peter Hoff</a>  on methods for high-dimensional covariance estimation.  I am collaborating with <a href="http://www.promislowlab.org/">Daniel Promislow</a> to apply this methodology for the analysis of metabolomic data from patients with Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. I received my PhD in the Department of Statistics at Harvard University.  There I was a member of <a href="http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~airoldi/">Edoardo Airoldi's</a> lab, where I worked on models for high-throughput 'omics data, missing data methodology, and statistics in networks.</p>
