      <td width="70%"> <p>I am currently a Moore/Sloan Data Science and WRF
      Innovation in Data Science Postdoctoral Fellow at
      the <a href="http://escience.washington.edu/" >eScience
      Institute</a> at the University of Washington.  I am working
      with <a href="http://www.stat.washington.edu/people/pdhoff/">Peter
      Hoff</a> on methods for data fusion
      and tensor covariance estimation.  I am also developing
      methodology for analyzing large and heterogeneous metabolomic
      data with <a href="http://www.promislowlab.org/">Daniel
      Promislow</a>.  I recently received my PhD in the Department of
      Statistics at Harvard University.  There I was a member
      of <a href="http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~airoldi/">Edoardo
      Airoldi's</a> lab, where I developed models for high-throughput
      biological data, missing data methodology, and statistics in networks.</p>
