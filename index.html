      Innovation in Data Science Postdoctoral Fellow at
      the <a href="http://escience.washington.edu/" >eScience
      Institute</a> at the University of Washington.  I am working
      with <a href="http://www.stat.washington.edu/people/pdhoff/">Peter
      Hoff</a> (Department of Statistics) on methods for data fusion
      and tensor covariance estimation.  We are collborating
      with <a href="http://www.promislowlab.org/">Daniel Promislow</a>
      (Department of Pathology) on developing methodology for handling
      large and heterogeneous metabolomic data.  I recently received
      my PhD in the Department of Statistics at Harvard University.
      There I was a member
      of <a href="http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~airoldi/">Edoardo
      Airoldi's</a> lab, where I worked on models for high-throughput
      'omics data, statistics in networks, and the intersection of the
