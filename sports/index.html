  <p>I am member of <a href="http://xyresearch.com">XY Research</a>, a sports analytics research group.  Our primary focus is the analysis of spatio-temporal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Player_tracking_(National_Basketball_Association)">player tracking data</a> from the NBA, NHL, and Premier League. Modern sports data is not just big data, its <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/rich-data-poor-data/">rich data</a>.  Further, there is a long tradition of using sports to illustrate challenging concepts in statistics and computation.  I have gained many statistical insights by analyzing sports data and I am constantly finding ways to connect the methodology I apply in sports to other domains.
