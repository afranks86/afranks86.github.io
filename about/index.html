<h1>Alexander Franks</h1>
<div class="blurb">
  <p>I am currently a Moore/Sloan Data Science and WRF Innovation in Data Science Postdoctoral Fellow at the <a href="http://escience.washington.edu/" >eScience Institute</a> at the University of Washington.  I am working with <a href="http://www.stat.washington.edu/people/pdhoff/">Peter Hoff</a> (Department of Statistics) on methods for data fusion and tensor covariance estimation.  We are collborating with <a href="http://www.promislowlab.org/">Daniel Promislow</a> (Department of Pathology) on developing methodology for handling large and heterogeneous metabolomic data.</p>

<p>I recently received my PhD in the Department of Statistics at Harvard University.  There I was a member of <a href="http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~airoldi/">Edoardo Airoldi's</a> lab, where I worked on models for high-throughput 'omics data, statistics in networks, and the intersection of the two.</p>

<!-- I am also a member of X,Y Resarch, a group run by Luke Bornn and Kirk Goldsberry.  Our research focuses on spatio-temporal methods and applications for optical tracking data from professional basketball.  You can see our presentation at the Sloan Sports Analytics Conference, check out this Wired video about our group, or read the Grantland article describing our work! </p> -->
